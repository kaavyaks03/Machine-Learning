# Iris Flower Classification using KNN


### *An Intermediate level project to classify the Iris flower using KNN Algorithm*

## Objective
Iris Flower basically has many levels of sub-classifications. This Machine Learning model is built on classifing the iris flower among the three types such as setos, verginica, versicolor. This ML model is trained using K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. This algorithm works on the basis of Euclidien distance as its distance metrics. Python modules such as Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib are used in the creation and testing phases of this ML model.
